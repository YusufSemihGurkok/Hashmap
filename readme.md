Hash Table Implementation
This repository contains C++ code that demonstrates a hash table implementation using separate chaining for collision resolution. The hash table allows you to insert, search, and remove key-value pairs efficiently.

Usage
After running the program, you will be presented with a menu where you can choose different operations on the hash table:

Insert element into the table: Allows you to insert a key-value pair into the hash table.
Search element from the key: Allows you to search for an element in the hash table based on a key.
Delete element at a key: Allows you to remove an element from the hash table based on a key.
Exit: Quits the program.
Follow the prompts on the screen to input your choices and interact with the hash table.
